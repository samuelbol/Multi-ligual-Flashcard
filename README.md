# Multi-ligual-Flashcard
A flashcard, also known as an index card, is a card with information on both sides that is intended to be used as a memory aid.
You can use this app's multilingual Flashcard GUI to help you remember the challenging words.  Amazing project idea by  Doctor Angela Yu.

The flashcard features a dialogue box with two distinct option fields for the user to choose the new language they want to learn (Foreign Language) and their native language (Native Language), respectively.
A word from the selected foreign language is flashed on a card in the CARD UI SETUP. The user can then stare at the word for three seconds before the card flips over to reveal the corresponding word in the user's native tongue.
Flashcards are an excellent tool for testing and improving memory by practicing information retrieval. Also, the most commonly used tool for those looking to improve/enhance their vocabulary or learn a new language.
